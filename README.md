Pesticide spraying is considered a very important activity in farming and from many years
this activity has claimed a lot of lives. Nowadays the farmers are playing the crucial role by
working hard in the agriculture lands and planting the crops for the societies living in different
regions for earning their minimum needs. In India the pesticide usage is higher which 70% is
whereas the world-wide pesticide usage is 44% only. Air is getting polluted by using these
pesticides. This is the major problem in agriculture. For this, a robot is developed to spray the
pesticides by its own and it is less harmful to the environment. The project is under wireless
sensor network. The application of wireless sensor network agricultural, Bio- medical,
Environmental etc. This bot will help the farmers very effectively. This bot will spray the
pesticides over entire the crop with the help of mobile phones. This bot can be easily
controllable. The bot sprinkles the pesticides covering all plants in the farm. This will use in
pest control and disease prevention application forms. By using this bot, the time and work of
the farmer will be reduced. The main component of the circuit is Arduino UNO controller and
it is also known as Heart of the robot. A driver circuit is connected to Arduino, which is used
for the movement of the robot. A pesticide pump is also used for transferring of liquid pesticide
to the sprayer head from the storage tank. The output unit consists of direction control unit
whichis used for controlling the directions via wirelessly. As per our directions, the spraying
unit will spray the fertilizers to the plants. Hereby, it is concluded that the machine learning and
image processing is very much useful to reduce the plant diagnosis disease. With the help of this
system, the diseases in plant and leaves are removed by spraying the pesticides. Since, this
machine is operated with the help of mobile and the distance between farmer and plants is high,
the farmer will not get effect by any disease and this machine is user-friendly also. In future if
any upgrade is required in this machine, the solar power source can also be implemented
